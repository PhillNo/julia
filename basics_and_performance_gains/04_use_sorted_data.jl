# Sorting arrays has at least two potential benefits:

# 1. When summing small floating point numbers, less roundoff is accumulated because the spacing between numbers that can be represented by floats on a machine is small for small numbers. i.e. for 0.00001 it is possible to add 0.00001 and get 0.00002. But for 1e100, adding 0.00001 may return 1e100. (This is may be an exaggeration, but the point is about the spacing between machine-representable numbers).

#Note: It might save time to use Kahan Summation and avoid sorting.

# 2. Branch prediction in a processor may be countereffective depending on what you are doing and sorting arrays can mitigate this.
