# Sorting arrays has at least two potential benefits:

# 1. To avoid accumulation of roundoff error it is best to take the summation of a set by adding smallest to largest.
#    This is because the possible numbers representable by a machine using floating pointgrows apart exponentially.
#    The spacing between all adjacent integers is 1.

#Note: It might save time to avoid sorting by using Kahan summation.

# 2. Branch prediction can be counterproductive on an unsorted array.
#    When using a loop to iterate an array, a branch check in the loop will assume to be true if the condition was true
#    many times prior. Sorting assures such a prediciton is correct and the processor doesn't not have to walk back.
